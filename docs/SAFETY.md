# Safety Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Read this entire document before using Facebook Timeline Cleanup. This tool permanently deletes your Facebook content.

## WARNING: PERMANENT DELETION

### Facebook Timeline Cleanup PERMANENTLY DELETES your posts
- **Deletions are NOT reversible**
- **No undo functionality exists**
- **Deleted content cannot be recovered**
- **Facebook does not provide restoration services**

## Essential Pre-Usage Steps

### 1. Backup Your Data

**BEFORE using this tool, download your Facebook data:**

1. Go to Facebook Settings & Privacy > Settings
2. Click "Your Facebook Information"
3. Select "Download Your Information"
4. Choose format: JSON (recommended) or HTML
5. Select date range: "All of my data"
6. Wait for Facebook to prepare your archive
7. Download and save the backup safely

### 2. Test Mode First

**ALWAYS use whatif mode for your first runs:**

```bash
# Test without any deletions
python facebook_timeline_cleanup.py --whatif --verbose --email your@email.com
```

**What whatif mode does:**
- Logs into your account
- Finds posts that would be deleted
- Shows detailed information about each post
- Creates comprehensive logs
- **Does NOT delete anything**

### 3. Start Small

**Begin with minimal settings:**
- 3-5 posts per session maximum
- 1-2 sessions total
- Long delays between sessions (10+ minutes)

```bash
# Conservative first run
python facebook_timeline_cleanup.py --sessions 2 --posts-per-session 3 --session-delay 600
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios

**DO NOT USE if:**
- You have not backed up your data
- You have not tested with whatif mode
- Your account uses two-factor authentication (2FA) without app passwords
- You are unsure about any aspect of the tool
- You are using this on behalf of someone else
- Your account is business-critical or irreplaceable

**Extremely High Risk:**
- Running with many sessions (>10)
- High posts per session (>20)
- Short delays between operations
- Running unattended for long periods

### Medium Risk Scenarios

**Use with extra caution if:**
- Your account contains irreplaceable content
- You share the account with others
- You use Facebook for business purposes
- You have a large number of tagged photos from others
- Your posts have significant engagement (likes, comments)

### Lower Risk Scenarios

**Relatively safer scenarios:**
- Personal account with recent backup
- Account you plan to deactivate anyway
- Extensive testing completed with whatif mode
- Small batch sizes and conservative timing
- Close monitoring during execution

## Account Safety
